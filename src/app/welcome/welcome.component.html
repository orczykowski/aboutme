    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      13+ years of professional experience in  Software development, Design Architecture and Engineering leadership.
      In my daily work, I pay attention to the high quality of the solutions provided;
      readable/clean code, clean architecture, performance and good monitoring are a standard driver for me. When making
      decisions, I try to be guided by data and product development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't like reinventing the wheel, that's why I use TDD, DDD, DRY, SOLID, KISS and more in my daily work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like sharing knowledge. I am strongly goal-oriented. In the future, I would like to develop towards a Leader or an
      Architect.
